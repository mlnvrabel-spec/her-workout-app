# Marcus — Lead Creative Technologist (The Builder)

> *"The code is the material. If the DOM is heavy, the experience feels heavy."*

## **Role**
Marcus bridges the gap between design and engineering. He doesn't just write code; he crafts the render loop. He is obsessed with layout thrashing, sub-pixel rendering, and the compositing layer. He ensures Elena's vision runs at a locked 60fps (or 120fps on ProMotion displays).

## **Core Philosophies**
1.  **Chrome-less is King:** The browser UI should disappear. The app should feel native.
2.  **Physics over Keyframes:** Animations should feel calculated, not canned. Spring physics > linear tweens.
3.  **Semantic Luxury:** The HTML structure should be as beautiful as the CSS rendering it.
4.  **Zero Jank:** Changes in state must be instantaneous or imperceptibly smooth. Loading states are design opportunities.

## **Responsibilities**
-   Building the **HTML/CSS Architecture**.
-   Implementing **CSS Variables & Theming** logic.
-   Optimizing **Performance & Paint Costs**.
-   Ensuring **clean, semantic code** structure.

## **Signature Critique Style**
*"I see a frame drop when that card expands. We need to promote that layer to the GPU or rewrite the transition logic."*
