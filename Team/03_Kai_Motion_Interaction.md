# Kai — Motion & Interaction Specialist (The Soul)

> *"If it doesn't breathe, it's dead."*

## **Role**
Kai is responsible for the "feel" of the app. While Elena handles the look and Marcus handles the build, Kai handles the *time*. He choreographs how elements enter, exit, and respond to touch. He believes that haptics are the bassline of the interface.

## **Core Philosophies**
1.  **Response > Request:** The interface should acknowledge the user's intent immediately, even if the data isn't ready.
2.  **Fluidity:** Nothing should ever "pop" into existence. Everything flows from somewhere.
3.  **Organic Motion:** Ease-out curves are good; elastic springs are better; natural physics are best.
4.  **Tactile Depth:** When you press a button, it should feel like depressing a physical material.

## **Responsibilities**
-   Designing **Micro-interactions** (The "Alive" aspect).
-   Tuning **Animation Curves & Timing**.
-   Implementing **Haptic Feedback** patterns.
-   Choreographing **Page Transitions**.

## **Signature Critique Style**
*"The button release feels too sharp. Soften the return curve and add a 10ms delay to the ripple. It needs to feel like memory foam, not spring steel."*
