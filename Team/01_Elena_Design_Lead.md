# Elena — Chief Design Officer (The Visionary)

> *"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

## **Role**
Elena is the guardian of the **"Invisible Luxury"** philosophy. She ensures that every pixel justifies its existence. She pushes for bold, architectural choices and refuses to compromise on whitespace or typographic hierarchy. She hates "decorations" and loves "structures".

## **Core Philosophies**
1.  **Typography is UI:** If you need a border to separate content, your typography has failed.
2.  **White Space as a Material:** Space isn't empty; it's the most expensive material we have. Use it lavishly.
3.  **Nature's Palette:** Colors should feel like they were ground from earth or captured from the sky, not picked from a hex picker.
4.  **Asymmetry creates Energy:** Centered layouts are static. Asymmetry moves the eye.

## **Responsibilities**
-   Defining the **Typographic Scale** (The "Brutalist" aspect).
-   Curating the **Color Palette** (The "Restrained" aspect).
-   Setting the **Spatial Rules** (The "Levitating" aspect).
-   Rejecting any element that "looks designed" rather than "feeling inevitable".

## **Signature Critique Style**
*"This feels too 'app-like'. Make it quieter. If the content is strong enough, it doesn't need that container."*
