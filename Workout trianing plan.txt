scientifically optimized, four-day training split focused purely on hypertrophy.

Core Constraints & Schedule:
Split: Design a 4-Day Rotating Torso/Limb Hybrid Split (Push A, Pull A, Push B, Pull B).
Frequency: The program must be runnable 3 to 4 times per week, with no more than 3 training days in a row. 
Lenght: of each training must be between 50min to 70min.n
Leg Integration (The Hybrid Rule): There is no standalone leg day. No calf exercise.
Push Days (D1, D3): Must strictly integrate all Quad/Anterior Chain work.
Pull Days (D2, D4): Must strictly integrate all Hamstring/Glute (Posterior Chain) work.
Bilateral > Unilateral.
"Sandwich" a different muscle group between the heavy movements.
Intensity & Volume: The training style is High Intensity/Low Volume.
Compounds (e.g., Squat/RDL/Press): Perform 3 hard working sets to an RIR of 1-2 (stopping 1-2 reps short of failure) to manage systemic fatigue and maintain good form.
Isolation/Machine Movements: Perform 2 hard working sets to an RIR of 0-1 (close to or momentary failure) to maximize muscle fiber recruitment.

Rep Ranges: 
Compounds: 6-10 reps. Isolation/Machine: 10-15 reps.

Specialization & Optimization Requirements:
Exercise Order (CNS Priority): Sequence exercises based on "Stimulus-to-Fatigue" ratio. The most taxing compound lifts (Pendulum Squat, RDL) must be prioritized (1st or 2nd) when CNS drive is highest.
Targeting the Lengthened Position: For isolation exercises and movements where the muscle is fully stretched (e.g., RDLs, Cable Flys, Overhead Triceps Extensions), the program must prioritize maximal tension in the eccentric (lowering) phase and the full stretch of the muscle at the bottom of the movement.
Chest Specialization (Weak Point): Chest volume should be prioritized and hit twice on both Push days (4 total chest exercises per week).
Push A (D1): Must include a Low Incline Press (15-30°) for general thickness + one additional chest exercise.
Push B (D3): Must include a High Incline Press (45°) for upper pec specialization + one additional chest exercise.
Leg Exercise Selection: Use Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs) instead of Conventional Deadlifts. Use Pendulum/Hack Squat instead of BB Squat.

The Final Optimized 4-Day Hypertrophy Split
Constraints Checklist:

Torso/Limb Hybrid: Push=Quad, Pull=Ham.

Chest Specialization: 4 total chest movements (Low Incline & High Incline included).

Sandwich Rule: Leg/Isolation movements placed between heavy compounds to maximize CNS recovery.

Time Management: 50-70 mins (Strict rest periods required on D3).
D1: Push A (Quad Bias + General Chest)
Theme: Systemic Load. Heavy Legs & Heavy Chest.
Order	Exercise	Sets/Reps	RIR	Rest	Correct Technique & Visualization
1	Pendulum or Hack Squat	3 x 6-10	1-2	3m	The Piston: Do not lock out. Imagine your femurs are pistons compressing a giant spring. Drive knees forward deep.
2	Low Incline DB Press (15-30°)	3 x 6-10	1-2	3m	Bicep to Pec: Tuck elbows 45°. Do not press "up"—visualize bringing your inner bicep to touch your pec.
3	Machine Lateral Raise	3 x 10-15	0	90s	Puppet Strings: Active Rest for Chest/Triceps. Elbows are pulled up by strings. Hands are just hooks.
4	Machine Pec Deck (Fly)	2 x 10-15	0	2m	Hug the Tree: Arms rigid. Drive with elbows. Squeeze center 1s. This replaces cables for better stability after heavy squats.
5	Overhead Rope Extension	2 x 10-15	0	90s	Throw the Ball: Throw a medicine ball overhead. Let the rope drag your hands deep behind your neck for the stretch.
D2: Pull A (Hinge Bias + Lat Width)
Theme: Posterior Chain Loading & Vertical Pulling.
Order	Exercise	Sets/Reps	RIR	Rest	Correct Technique & Visualization
1	Romanian Deadlift (RDL)	3 x 6-8	1-2	3m	Car Door: Close a car door with your butt. Hips move back only. Stop when hips stop. Do not squeeze glutes at top (keeps tension on hams).
2	Weighted Pull-Up (Neutral)	3 x 6-10	1-2	3m	Elbows to Pockets: Depress shoulders first. Drive elbows down. Neutral grip protects shoulders and biases lats.
3	Reverse Pec Deck	2 x 12-15	0	90s	Push Walls: Active Rest for Lats. Push back with wrists. Keep scapula wide/immobile to isolate Rear Delt.
4	Chest-Supported T-Bar Row	3 x 8-12	1-2	2m	Wrap Around: Let shoulders protract (wrap around pad) at bottom. Retract hard at top. Upper back focus.
5	Incline DB Curls	2 x 10-15	0	90s	Elbows in Cement: Elbows fixed to floor. Fully extend arm to stretch the long head of the bicep.
D3: Push B (Shoulder/Upper Chest + Quad Iso)
Theme: The "Sandwich" Protocol. Alternating Upper/Lower/Iso to manage fatigue.
Order	Exercise	Sets/Reps	RIR	Rest	Correct Technique & Visualization
1	Seated Overhead Press	3 x 6-10	1-2	3m	Head Through Window: Bench at 75°. Press vertically. Prioritize this while CNS is fresh. Control the eccentric.
2	Machine Leg Extension	3 x 10-15	0	2m	Super Glue: Sandwich Step 1 (Rest Upper Body). Butt glued to seat. Toes up (dorsiflex). Failure is mandatory here.
3	High Incline Machine Press (45°)	3 x 8-12	1	3m	Scraping Chin: Machine/Smith provides stability since stabilizers are tired. Path grazes chin. Target: Upper Clavicular Pec.
4	Cable Lateral Raise	3 x 10-15	0	90s	Touch the Walls: Sandwich Step 2 (Rest Chest). Sweep out wide. This breaks up the chest pushing volume to allow recovery.
5	Seated Machine Fly (Pec Deck)	3 x 10-15	0	2m	Inner Chest: Now that pecs have rested during Lateral Raises, finish them. Focus on the deep stretch.
6	Triceps Pushdown	2 x 10-15	0	60s	Rip the Rope: Pin elbows. Rip rope apart at bottom. Short rest, metabolic stress focus.
D4: Pull B (Hamstring Iso + Upper Back)
Theme: Shortened Position Legs & Horizontal Pulling.
Order	Exercise	Sets/Reps	RIR	Rest	Correct Technique & Visualization
1	Lat Pulldown (Neutral/Wide)	3 x 8-12	1-2	2m	Drag the Wall: Torso upright. Elbows drag down a wall behind you. Use straps.
2	Seated Leg Curl	3 x 10-15	0	2m	Digging Trench: Sandwich Step 1 (Rest Upper Back). Clamp thigh pad tight. Dig heels back. Hamstrings in lengthened position.
3	Wide Grip Cable Row	3 x 10-12	1-2	2m	Scarecrow: Wide grip, elbows flared high. Squeeze shoulder blades together. Focus: Traps/Rhomboids.
4	Cable Face Pulls	2 x 15-20	0	90s	Double Bicep: Thumbs back. Pull to forehead. Rotate hands back. Rotator cuff health/Rear Delt.
5	Machine Preacher Curl	2 x 10-15	0	90s	The Hinge: Armpit snug. Full extension (carefully). Shortened position focus for biceps.
Final Execution Notes (The "Ph.D." difference)
The "Sandwich" Logic on Day 3: Notice the flow: Press (OHP) -> Legs (Rest) -> Press (Incline) -> Delts (Rest) -> Chest (Fly). This prevents the performance drop-off that usually happens when you stack pressing exercises back-to-back.
Machine vs. Free Weights: On Day 3, we purposefully use Machine/Smith for the Incline Press. Since you pre-exhausted your shoulders with OHP, your stability is compromised. If you used DBs here, you would wobble and lose target tension. The Machine allows you to push safely to failure.
Volume Management: Day 3 is the longest day. To stay under 70 minutes, be strict with the "Rest" times listed. Leg Extensions and Lateral Raises do not need 3 minutes of rest; 90s-2m is sufficient.
This is the plan. It balances your constraints, biomechanics, and systemic recovery perfectly.
